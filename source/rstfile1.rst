**Purpose of this document**

This document explains common software and hardware-documentation terms shown on PHYTEC product download pages. The exact files and available features depend on the specific PHYTEC product and BSP release. Always select the documentation from the download page for the exact module or board being used.

**Software and BSP terms** 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**BSP — Board Support Package ** 

A set of board-specific software, metadata, and configuration used to support Linux on a particular PHYTEC product/board. PHYTEC BSP documentation covers tasks such as building the BSP, booting, updating software, device-tree configuration, and accessing peripherals. A BSP integrates the pieces needed for the supported board; it is not just one file.

**Yocto Project / Yocto Manual** 

Yocto is the build framework used to create a customized embedded Linux system. PHYTEC's Yocto Manual explains the Yocto version used by its BSPs, how to install and customize the BSP, and how to use tools such as Poky and BitBake. BitBake executes build tasks based on project metadata.

**Linux kernel** 

The kernel is the core of Linux. It manages hardware resources and provides drivers and interfaces used by applications. In a PHYTEC BSP, kernel sources and configuration are integrated into the BSP build. Device-tree settings describe board hardware so the kernel can configure supported peripherals.

**U-Boot** 

U-Boot is a bootloader commonly used by embedded Linux systems. It performs early boot tasks and loads/starts the Linux kernel with the relevant device tree and boot configuration. PHYTEC BSPs include U-Boot recipes or board-specific bootloader integration where applicable.

**Release Notes** 

Release notes describe a particular BSP release, including changes, fixes, known issues, compatibility information, and other release-specific details. Read them before upgrading or selecting a release.

**Development Environment Guide** 

PHYTEC describes this guide as instructions for working with its prepared virtual-machine development environment, Eclipse and Qt Creator, and/or setting up a Linux host system. It helps developers prepare the tools needed to build and run applications on a PHYTEC product.
